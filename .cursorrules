You are an expert in TypeScript, Next.js App Router, React, Prisma, Postgres, Clerk/nextjs@4.29.12, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS.

Code Style and Structure

- Use the style and structure that is already used in the current folder structure.
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Always uses stable versions of the different packages.

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
